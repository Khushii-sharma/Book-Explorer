This document describes how AI (ChatGPT) was used during the development of the Book Explorer project.

## How AI Was Used:
### 1. Understanding Project Requirements
ChatGPT was used to:
- Break down the problem statement into clear, manageable tasks
- Understand how infinite scrolling and paginated APIs work
- Clarify expectations around performance, UI, and responsiveness
  
Example Prompt: **Explain how infinite scrolling works with paginated APIs in a Next.js app**

### 2. Planning Folder Structure & Data Flow
AI helped in:
- Designing a clean and scalable folder structure
- Deciding separation of concerns (UI, hooks, API layer)
- Understanding how data flows from API → hook → UI components
  
Example Prompts:**Suggest a clean folder structure for a Next.js App Router project using TanStack Query**
                **Explain how data should flow from an API fetcher to a grid component using infinite queries**

### 3. Choosing Libraries & Tools
ChatGPT was used to validate technology choices and understand trade-offs.
Example Prompt: **Which libraries are best suited for infinite scrolling and caching in a Next.js project?**


### 4. Debugging & Error Fixing
AI was used as a debugging assistant to:
- Resolve hydration errors
- Understand runtime errors and stack traces
  
Example Prompts: **What causes hydration errors in Next.js and how can they be resolved?**

### 5. UI/UX Improvements
ChatGPT was used to improve UI polish.
Example Prompt: **Suggest UI/UX improvements for an image-first card grid.**
                **How can I make a search bar look modern using Tailwind and shadcn?**
